# What
The CSO makes Electoral Division and LEA data available on Geohive. The maps aren't very good, though.
This is a better, combined map.

# How To Use
Toggle between ED and LEA polygons by pressing the button.
You can find the area(s) in which you're located by pressing the "locate me" button.
You search for a specific place and see its ED and LEA information by using the search field on the map.

# Something doesn't work!
Open an [issue](/issues). No guarantees, though: we're all busy.
